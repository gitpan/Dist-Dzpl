NAME
    Dist::Dzpl - An alternative configuration format (.pl) and invoker for
    Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 0.0010

SYNOPSIS
    Below is an example file that would exist in your distribution root,
    called "dist.pl" or "dzpl":

        #!/usr/bin/env perl
        use Dzpl
            name => 'Acme-Xyzzy',
            version => '0.0001',
            author => 'Ja P. Hacker <japh@example.com>',
            license => 'Perl5',
            copyright => 'Ja P. Hacker', # Will automaticaly fill in the current year

            # Declare prerequisites for runtime and testing (building)
            # Alternatively, you can specify 'recommend' or 'prefer'
            require => q/
                Moose

                [Test]
                Test::Most
            /;
        ;

        # Declare some plugins to use. The regular expression following
        # the @Basic bundle is a filter excluding Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Readme
        plugin
            '@Basic' => qr/Readme$/,
            'PodWeaver',
            'PkgVersion',
            'ReadmeFromPod',
            '=Dist::Dzpl::Plugin::DynamicManifest',
            '=Dist::Dzpl::Plugin::CopyReadmeFromBuild',
        ;

        run;

    Then, from the commandline:

        dzpl build      # Build the distribution via $zilla->build
        dzpl dzil help  # The usual Dist::Dzil::App help message

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Dzpl is a wrapper around Dist::Zilla, allowing an alternative,
    flexible configuration mechanism. Instead of describing your
    distribution using an .ini file, you can use a Perl .pl script

    Your configuation file can be named "dzpl", "dz.pl", or "dist.pl", and
    will be picked in that order

    Dist::Dzpl is dz*P*l is to .pl as Dist::Zilla is dz*I*l is to .ini
